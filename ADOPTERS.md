Kubeapps uses Pinniped to [enable SSO authentication](https://github.com/kubeapps/kubeapps/blob/master/docs/user/using-an-OIDC-provider-with-pinniped.md) when running on clusters where SSO cannot be configured for the cluster API server.

## Adding your organization to the list of adopters

If you are using Pinniped and would like to be included in the list of Pinniped Adopters, add an SVG version of your logo that is less than 150 KB to
the [img directory](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/pinniped/tree/main/site/themes/pinniped/static/img) in this repo and submit a pull request with your change including 1-2 sentences describing how your organization is using Pinniped. Name the image file something that
reflects your company (e.g., if your company is called Acme, name the image acme.svg). Please feel free to send us a message in [#pinniped](https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C01BW364RJA) with any questions you may have.
