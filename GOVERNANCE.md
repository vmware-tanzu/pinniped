# Pinniped Governance
This document defines the project governance for Pinniped.

# Overview
**Pinniped** is committed to building an open, inclusive, productive and self-governing open source community focused on building authentication services for Kubernetes clusters. The
community is governed by this document which defines how all members should work together to achieve this goal.

# Code of Conduct
The Pinniped community abides by this [code of conduct](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/pinniped/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Community Roles
* **Users:** Members that engage with the Pinniped community via any medium (Slack, GitHub, mailing lists, etc.).
* **Contributors:** Do regular contributions to the Pinniped project (documentation, code reviews, responding to issues, participating in proposal discussions, contributing code, etc.).
* **Maintainers:** Responsible for the overall health and direction of the project. They are the final reviewers of PRs and responsible for Pinniped releases.

# Maintainers
New maintainers must be nominated by an existing maintainer and must be elected by a supermajority of existing maintainers. Likewise, maintainers can be removed by a supermajority of the existing maintainers or can resign by notifying one of the maintainers.

**Note:** If a maintainer leaves their employer they are still considered a maintainer of Pinniped, unless they voluntarily resign. Employment is not taken into consideration when determining maintainer eligibility unless the company itself violates our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/pinniped/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Decision Making
Ideally, all project decisions are resolved by consensus. If impossible, any maintainer may call a vote. Unless otherwise specified in this document, any vote will be decided by a supermajority of maintainers.

## Supermajority
A supermajority is defined as two-thirds of members in the group. A supermajority of maintainers is required for certain decisions as outlined in this document. A supermajority vote is equivalent to the number of votes in favor being at least twice the number of votes against. A vote to abstain equals not voting at all. For example, if you have 5 maintainers who all cast non-abstaining votes, then a supermajority vote is at least 4 votes in favor. Voting on decisions can happen on the mailing list, GitHub, Slack, email, or via a voting service, when appropriate. Maintainers can either vote "agree, yes, +1", "disagree, no, -1", or "abstain". A vote passes when supermajority is met.

## Lazy Consensus
To maintain velocity in Pinniped, the concept of [Lazy Consensus](http://en.osswiki.info/concepts/lazy_consensus) is practiced.

Other maintainers may chime in and request additional time for review, but should remain cognizant of blocking progress and abstain from delaying progress unless absolutely needed. The expectation is that blocking progress is accompanied by a guarantee to review and respond to the relevant action in short order.

Lazy consensus does not apply to the process of:
* Removal of maintainers from Pinniped

## Updating Governance
All substantive changes in Governance, including substantive changes to the proposal process, require a supermajority agreement by all maintainers.

# Proposal Process
The proposal process is defined in [proposals/README.md](proposals/README.md).
