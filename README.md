## Overview

Pinniped provides identity services to Kubernetes.

Pinniped allows cluster administrators to easily plug in external identity
providers (IDPs) into Kubernetes clusters. This is achieved via a uniform
install procedure across all types and origins of Kubernetes clusters,
declarative configuration via Kubernetes APIs, enterprise-grade integrations
with IDPs, and distribution-specific integration strategies.

### Example Use Cases

* Your team uses a large enterprise IDP, and has many clusters that they
  manage. Pinniped provides:
  * Seamless and robust integration with the IDP
  * Easy installation across clusters of any type and origin
  * A simplified login flow across all clusters
* Your team shares a single cluster. Pinniped provides:
  * Simple configuration to integrate an IDP
  * Individual, revocable identities

### Architecture

Pinniped offers credential exchange to enable a user to exchange an external IDP
credential for a short-lived, cluster-specific credential. Pinniped supports various
IDP types and implements different integration strategies for various Kubernetes
distributions to make authentication possible.
