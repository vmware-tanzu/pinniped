## Overview FAKE

Pinniped provides identity services to Kubernetes.

- Easily plug in external identity providers into Kubernetes clusters while offering a simple install and configuration experience. Leverage first class integration with Kubernetes and kubectl command-line.
- Give users a consistent, unified login experience across all your clusters, including on-premises and managed cloud environments.
- Securely integrate with an enterprise IDP using standard protocols or use secure, externally managed identities instead of relying on simple, shared credentials.
