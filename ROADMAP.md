## Pinniped Project Roadmap

### About this document

This document provides a high-level overview of the next big features the maintainers are planning to work on. This
should serve as a reference point for Pinniped users and contributors to understand where the project is heading, and
help determine if a contribution could be conflicting with a longer term plan.
The [Pinniped project backlog](https://github.com/orgs/vmware-tanzu/projects/43/) is prioritized based on this roadmap,
and it provides a more granular view of what the maintainers are working on a day-to-day basis.

### How to help

Discussion on the roadmap is welcomed. If you want to provide suggestions, use cases, and feedback to an item in the
roadmap, please reach out to the maintainers using one of the methods described in the project's
[README.md](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/pinniped#discussion).
[Contributions](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/pinniped/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to Pinniped are also welcomed.

### How to add an item to the roadmap

One of the most important aspects in any open source community is the concept of proposals. Large changes to the
codebase and / or new features should be preceded by
a [proposal](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/pinniped/tree/main/proposals) in our repo.
For smaller enhancements, you can open an issue to track that initiative or feature request.
We work with and rely on community feedback to focus our efforts to improve Pinniped and maintain a healthy roadmap.

### Current Roadmap

The following table includes the current roadmap for Pinniped. Please take the timelines and dates as proposals and
goals. Priorities and requirements change based on community feedback, roadblocks encountered, community contributions,
etc. If you depend on a specific item, we encourage you to reach out for updated status information, or help us deliver
that feature by [contributing](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/pinniped/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to Pinniped.
