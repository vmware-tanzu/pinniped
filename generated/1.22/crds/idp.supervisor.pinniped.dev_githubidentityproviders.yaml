          GitHubIdentityProvider describes the configuration of an upstream GitHub identity provider.
          This upstream provider can be configured with either a GitHub App or a GitHub OAuth2 App.


          Right now, only web-based logins are supported, for both the pinniped-cli client and clients configured
          as OIDCClients.

                          teams within the listed GitHub organizations. Additional login rules or group filtering can optionally be
                          provided as policy expression on any Pinniped Supervisor FederationDomain that includes this IDP.


                          The configured GitHub App or GitHub OAuth App must be allowed to see membership in the listed organizations,
                          otherwise Pinniped will not be aware that the user belongs to the listed organization or any teams

                      Can be either "name" or "slug". Defaults to "slug".


                      GitHub team names can contain upper and lower case characters, whitespace, and punctuation (e.g. "Kube admins!").


                      GitHub team slugs are lower case alphanumeric characters and may contain dashes and underscores (e.g. "kube-admins").


                      Group names as presented to Kubernetes will always be prefixed by the GitHub organization name followed by a
                      forward slash (e.g. "my-org/my-team"). GitHub organization login names can only contain alphanumeric characters
                      or single hyphens, so the first forward slash `/` will be the separator between the organization login name and
                      the team name or slug.


                      If desired, an admin could configure identity transformation expressions on the Pinniped Supervisor's
                      FederationDomain to further customize how these group names are presented to Kubernetes.

                      Username configures which property of the GitHub user record shall determine the username in Kubernetes.


                      Can be either "id", "login", or "login:id". Defaults to "login:id".


                      GitHub's user login attributes can only contain alphanumeric characters and non-repeating hyphens,
                      and may not start or end with hyphens. GitHub users are allowed to change their login name,
                      although it is inconvenient. If a GitHub user changed their login name from "foo" to "bar",
                      then a second user might change their name from "baz" to "foo" in order to take the old
                      username of the first user. For this reason, it is not as safe to make authorization decisions
                      based only on the user's login attribute.


                      If desired, an admin could configure identity transformation expressions on the Pinniped Supervisor's
                      FederationDomain to further customize how these usernames are presented to Kubernetes.


                      Defaults to "login:id", which is the user login attribute, followed by a colon, followed by the unique and
                      unchanging integer ID number attribute. This blends human-readable login names with the unchanging ID value
                      from GitHub. Colons are not allowed in GitHub login attributes or ID numbers, so this is a reasonable
                      choice to concatenate the two values.
