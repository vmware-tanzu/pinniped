#
# This file lists the versions of Kubernetes to use for codegen.
# They must be listed newest to oldest.
#
# New releases are listed at https://kubernetes.io/releases/.
# Older releases are listed at https://kubernetes.io/releases/patch-releases/.
#
# Rule of thumb: Once a minor version has been out of support for a year
# (see https://endoflife.date/kubernetes), then remove it from this file
# and delete the generated/X.XX directory for that Kube version from git.
#
# Whenever a new version is added to this file, or when a version number
# is edited in this file, please run hack/update.sh.
