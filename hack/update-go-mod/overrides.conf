# We would like to use the version of cdproto that is selected by our current
# verison of chromedp. There should be no need to keep bumping cdproto to the
# bleeding edge version. "go mod tidy" will automatically bump cdproto whenever
# we bump chromedp, but only enough to match the version of cdproto from
# chromedp's go.mod file.
