# Project Scope

The Pinniped project is guided by the following principles.
* Pinniped lets you plug any external identitiy providers into
  Kubernetes. These integrations follow enterprise-grade security principles.
* Pinniped is easy to install and use on any Kubernetes cluster via
  distribution-specific integration mechanisms.
* Pinniped uses a declarative configuration via Kubernetes APIs.
* Pinniped provides optimal user experience when authenticating to many
  clusters at one time.
* Pinniped provides enterprise-grade security posture via secure defaults and
  revocable or very short-lived credentials.
* Where possible, Pinniped will contribute ideas and code to upstream
  Kubernetes.

When contributing to Pinniped, please consider whether your contribution follows
these guiding principles.

## Out Of Scope

The following items are out of scope for the Pinniped project.
* Authorization.
* Standalone identity provider for general use.
* Machine-to-machine (service) identity.
* Running outside of Kubernetes.
